# Python Learning Journey

This repository documents my structured Python learning path, built deliberately over several months with a focus on reusable code, correct mental models, and small systems rather than one-off scripts.

Progression is intentional:

**structured learning > reusable code > small systems**

## 01_oop_and_modules / users

This section focuses on object-oriented design in Python, including:
- class design and initialization
- inheritance vs composition
- state management inside objects
- modularization across files with clean imports

Start with `demo.py` to see how the components interact.
